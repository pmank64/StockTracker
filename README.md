# Stock Tracker Flask Application

## Project Summary

This project is currently in progress, and it is intended to allow a user to search for a particular stock, and view statistics and graphs that aid in making good investing decisions. The mission of this project is to make investing easier and more straight forward by providing educational content that helps the user not just search for their favorite companies but learn about investing as well.

## Current Features

Currently, the app allows the user to search for a particular stock and view a graph of the price over time. The app also displays various metrics about a stock, including the 52-week low, 52-week high, and much more. The app has the capability to display the sentiment of a particular stock, or a measure of how the public feels about the stock.

## Future Work

In the future, plans for this app include adding much more educational content including videos, and more useful and better annotated graphs and statistics. Also, other modern technologies should be incorporated, including [Dash]( https://plotly.com/dash/) for better and more interactive visualizations.

In addition, implementation of machine learning to identify underpriced IPOs, and perform other financial analysis would help to differentiate the app.
